I am a Front-End Developer with expertise in React.js, JavaScript (ES6+), Next.js, and modern web technologies. Over the past 10+
years, I have built a strong foundation in IT infrastructure, but my primary focus has been developing scalable and user-friendly web
applications. I have worked on projects ranging from hospital management systems to e-commerce platforms, leveraging
technologies like React.js, Next.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. My experience in IT gives me a unique problem-solving approach,
ensuring that I build secure, optimized, and high-performance web applications. I'm passionate about crafting seamless user
experiences and staying updated with the latest front-end technologies.
